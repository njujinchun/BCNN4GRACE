This is a PyTorch implementation of Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BCNN) for reconstructing the missing GRACE(-FO) TWSA fields of 2017-2018 from hydroclimatic predictors in an image-to-image (field-to-field) regression manner. The codes will be released soon upon publication of our manuscript.
